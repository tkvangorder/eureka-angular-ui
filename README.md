To get up and running :


1. Install Node (4 or higher) & npm (3 or higher). [Node Install Page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Development server
Run `ng serve -proxy-config proxy-config.json` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Note: The `proxy-config.json` will proxy all calls to /eureka/app/* to an external eureka server. See this file to change which Eureka server you are using during development.
## Code scaffolding
